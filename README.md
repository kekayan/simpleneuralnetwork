# simpleneuralnetwork
a simple neural network in TFlearn
##All deep learning programs follow the same core logic:
```
1.It starts with including libraries, then importing and cleaning the data. All the input are translated into digits, regardless if itâ€™s images, audio or a sensory data. These long lists of numbers are the input for our neural networks.
2.You design your neural network, e.g. choose the type and amount of layer to have in your network.
3.Then it enters the learning process. It knows the input and output values and searches for the correlation between them.
4.The final step gives you a prediction from your trained neural network.
```
